# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. Face recognition has been around for a long time. Taking a step forward, human emotion, as expressed by the face and felt by the brain, can be mimicked in video, electric signal (EEG), or image form. Modern artificial intelligent systems need to be able to replicate and evaluate reactions from human faces, therefore emotion detection is critical. This can help you make more educated decisions, whether it's about determining intent, promoting deals, or avoiding security threats. Recognizing emotions from photos or video is a simple operation for the human eye, but it's a difficult challenge for machines that necessitates the use of numerous image processing techniques for feature extraction. 

Using various models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNNs, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and CNNs, we will be developing an application that makes decisions based on the predefined features set in the program and the features that are fed by the input image to predict six types of mood of the given input image- angry, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral.
